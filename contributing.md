# Contribution Guidelines

Network Science crosses many disciplinary boundaries and
a great variety of tools are used which are developed in diverse
areas. Thus, material is scattered and not always accessible to all.
The goal of this awesome list is to become a central place for resources that can help those interested in teaching network science and related fields.

Please contribute to the list by sending [pull
requests](https://github.com/gesiscss/awesome-teaching-about-networks/pulls)
or by fixing an
[issue](https://github.com/gesiscss/awesome-teaching-about-networks/issues).
Suggestions for new sections, or restructuring of sections are also welcome.
If you are unfamiliar with Github, you can also email brennanantone@gmail.com

This project is released with a
[Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this
project you agree to abide by its terms.
