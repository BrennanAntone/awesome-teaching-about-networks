# Interactive Teaching Exercises
> Teaching about "network thinking" can be aided with sychronous or asynchronous teaching exercises that demonstrate applications of network analysis and prompt reflection around learners.
> Below is a list of short-term activities that can be used in courses, professional workshops, etc.
> Unless otherwise noted, all teaching exercises are available for free
